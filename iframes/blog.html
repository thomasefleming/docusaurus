            <p>Got rid of the hamburger menu, but still working on my navigation. During my experimenting last year with layouts, I really liked just using the three o's in toronto as navigation buttons. But how do you make people realize the o's are buttons? I just implemented some neon colour glow fade in and fade out effects for the portions of the header that are links. Next I think I'll make some type of hover effect for the os so it tells you where it will take you before clicking and my name will just take you back to the site homepage.</p>
            <p>So next up is figuring out what the three landing pages will be, the chiclet button pages and what to name them: Tech stuff, ideas/current events, and pop/art stuff most likely. They overlap, but all lists and categories are artificial constructs, so whatever.</p>
            <p>I also set up a react environment for javascript stuff. Still don't really understand what I did there. But some websites with cool animations use it, and its opensource so I thought I'd give it a try. I got one animation working briefly on my PC in a browser, with a local instance of a webpage, but still having some issues using it on the live site. React wasn't fully ported over cause I needed to add a file called .nojekyll to my site root directory. The names of these things are hilarious. I have no idea what I'm doing half the time, but I end up knowing more than when I started.</p>
            <p>Oh and my fonts are now locally saved, which was super easy. Google's font site is really cool, just download the fonts and drop them in your folder and update your HTML to reference the appropriate font for your page.</p>

            <p>Claude.ai redid a few of my site pages in a 1970s retro futuristic style yesterday and it looks really cool. But upon closer inspection I realized the changes rely on an external Google api stylesheet. Why should that be a concern?</p>
            <p>In memoriam: (1) Google Reader (2005–2013), (2) Google Wave (2009–2012), (3) Google+ (2011–2019), (4) Google Hangouts (2013–2022), (5) Inbox by Gmail (2014–2019), (6) Picasa (2002–2016), (7) Google Talk (2005–2017), (8) Google Allo (2016–2019), (9) Google Buzz (2010–2011), (10) Google Code (2006–2016), (11) Google Play Music (2011–2020), (12) Google Daydream (2016–2019), (13) Project Ara (2013–2016), (14) Google Glass (2013–2015), (15) Google Nexus (2010–2015), (16) Google URL Shortener (2009–2019), (17) Google Notebook (2006–2011), (18) Google Answers (2002–2006), (19) Orkut (2004–2014), (20) Google Hire (2017–2020), (21) Google Health (2008–2012), (22) Google Notebook (2006–2011), (23) Google Latitude (2009–2013), (24) Google Play Newsstand (2013–2018), (25) YouTube Gaming (2015–2019), (26) Google Currents (2011–2013, 2020–2023).</p>
            <p>To future proof the future theme, Claude advised to make a fonts folder on my site root and download the fonts used on the new pages fonts(dot)google(dot)com, and update the index.html file to point to the new folder. Then it's all local and no worry about an API URL breaking in the future. Lesson learned.</p>

            <p>Got the remaining pages migrated over from the other platform, so now it's all on github. The library page is still a bit boring, I need to restyle it, but Claude.ai in half a second took my prompt, "This webpage is super dull, can you jazz it up and make it look, using like retro futuristic 1970s vibe? This should be the main color to play with rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.7) and use some fun retro futiristic 1970s fonts. It's a page to provide links to artificial intelligence tools:" And then it whipped up a fun page for links, it's on the chiclets page. I liked the Logan's Run aesthetic, so I used it on the data tools page, as well as the updated second and third "o" links in toronto in the header.</p>
            <p>Next up I may make the chiclets a little more 3-D, but not too much, I like the minimalist aesthetic. And I think I'll dive more into javascript next week. Claude in half a second made an amazing javascript animation based on this prompt, "I want to make a cool java script animation with text in color rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.7) in Comfortaa style font. Make it look really crisp and advanced with the text connecting and disconnecting like neurons firing in the brain."</p>
                <p>The friction, the learning curves to use tools to make things in javascript and other languages are disappearing, now you can describe what you are thinking, the more descriptive the better and out comes a close approximation of what you were thinking of. And you then iterate, perfecting through natural language what your idea is to make it become real in the code. It's really really cool. It's like next level storyboarding. Then a more seasoned human coder can take what you've visualized in detail and clean up the code.</p>
            <p>Pretty incredible, and these are all free tools, and they are exponentially (no pun intended) improving, next year things will be more than twice as powerful than they were a few months ago. Small business owners should all have amazing websites soon. You can make one yourself, all you pay is the hosting fee, the domain name registration, and your time designing a site.</p>
                <p>If you were a kid that used a word processor in the 1980s, then you can learn HTML and CSS easily. The java part you hand off to the AI and plug in the code to the HMTL. There's tons of cool opensource javascript animations on codepen.io and of course github.io. On my list eventually is to update my menu with a JavaScript animation.</p>
            <p>P.S. I learned that Google's iframe coding doesn't like external links, so I decided to create a separate blog page and embed that html blog as an iframe here. For some odd reason, google docs kept showing vertical lines between paragraphs, during my frustration I just decided to do the blog this way.</p>

            <p>Today, I'm gonna share some screenshots with ChatGPT 4o of this i-frame embedded on the DEV homepage on mobile and desktop and see if it can then figure out what needs to be tweaked with the coding (along with the index.hmtl and styles.css files). My site is starting to use a lot of CSS containers, something I hadn't used before, I just used to include the styling on the same page using simpler 1990s HTML tags and coding. The containers can conflict with each other and I'm sure if someone more seasoned looked at my CSS page they probably would get the giggles. But I'm gonna keep building things this way, with fresh eyes and then do the cleanup later. The end state of the template will ideally be very easy to read with simplified CSS containering; I want to include detailed comments within the code like "See xyz in the CSS", or "if you want to change this colour, don't do it in the CSS, add some customized styles in the header," but that will take a while. For now I'm gonna keep being tutored by my buddies Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Mistral and Perplexity.</p>
            <p>My two goals for this hobby project today are to (1) fix the width for mobile of this i-frame, and (2) move the remaining pages that aren't yet hosted on github over to github - thankfully there aren't too many of those left. Also, I started to add some TXT notes in the backup folder of DEV when I make "major" changes, major for a newby.</p>
            <p>I got (1) done, lots of frustrating back and forth with ChatGPT and Claude. Copilot took a look at all the revisions which looked perfect except  Xponential's attribution text was pushed off the left of his gif. Copilot updated the <style> header on the page without messing with the CSS file and in the <main> it moved the <div> attribution container up to the top of the <div> chiclets-container. And then Copilot told me something obvious to do in Google Docs, switch from narrow to wide view (duh), so now i-frame looks good. I'm gonna leave (2) for tomorrow, now I'm gonna turn to some data analytics stuff for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

            <p>Today, I registered my own custom domain for 85 cents (Canadian), tax included. Then, after a suggestion from Claude, I opened a free cloudflare account and used it to make my site https (more secure), but so far haven't gotten this  /dev site to be https (it's on a separate github repository).</p>
            <p>And now I've just embedded an i-frame of this Google doc on my homepage. All the code is on my github page, so feel free to use the template (ChatGPT 4o showed me how to do it, and then I made some tweaks, like a couple <br> tags).</p>
            <p>Also check out the new Copilot iOS mobile app, I downloaded it last night. I love the new UI aesthetic, the water effect is really cool.</p>
            <p>P.S. I just looked at the i-frame on my iPhone and it's way too narrow. I've done a few revisions of the coding and it's a little better, but still no luck getting it fully optimized for mobile, and I've hit my Claude.ai usage limit. Claude has been really good at this kind of stuff. :/</p>
